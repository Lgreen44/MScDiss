Genetics is increasingly becoming a quantitatively driven field ever since the inception of easily available and low cost high throughput sequencing technology, in 2001 it cost approximately one-hundred million dollars to sequence a human genome now it can be done for about one thousand. This reduction in time and cost for sequencing has resulted in vast quantities in data being produced which has caused new problems to emerge in terms of analysis. The field of Bioinformatics emerged from this, providing a cross-disciplinary approach to Biological problems with applications within evolution, drug and protein discovery and genetic classification. The tool-set of Bioinformaticians has further expanded with the advent of Machine Learning technology, where techniques such as supervised, unsupervised and deep learning models can be employed to identify patterns, derive insights and develop prediction with noisy high feature data that is typical to genetic projects. Combining these techniques with algorithms such as Principle Component Analysis and K-means clustering can further improve accuracy of models. Within this paper, the field of population genetics is introduced alongside key concepts and projects relating to the field of Bioinformatics. This is brought together in a synthesis with data-science with a simple Machine Learning informed Bioinformatic pipeline in which genetic data is clustered to identify a relationship with geographic space, building on the work conducted by \cite{novembre-2008}, through techniques highlighted above it was found that through a relatively simple Bioinformatic/ML pipeline insights into population structures can be accuratley derived.
